// iBus2PPM v2 version 1.01
// Arduino Nano/Pro code to read FlySky iBus and output
// x channels of CPPM
// BaseFlight supports iBus, CleanFlight got it, and even betaflight.
// But since iBus is 115k2 serial, it requires an UART, sacrificing the ability to
// use GPS on the NAZE32.
// Another use for this is as a link to a 433MHz radio Tx
//          FlySky i6 (with 10 channel patch) -> iA6B -> iBus2PPM -> 433MHz LRS
// Nobody wants to use trainer cable if they can run wireless.

// I use Turnigy TGY-i6 aka Flysky FS-i6 transmitter and iA6B Rx. I am running hacked firmware from
// this thread to get 10 channels over iBus: http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2486545
// the i6 has the 4 channels for the sticks, 4 switches, and 2 analog potentiometers. So can generate
// 10 independent channels.
// Latest hacked firmware allow to combine 2 switches to one 4 or 6 channel switch, which I use for flight modes,
// thus I get only 9 channels (could make channel 10 a derived channel).
// As a result, I chose to send  9 channels over PPM
// Unfortunately, there is no way to input high channels in trainer mode yet. Would be nice for head-tracker.
